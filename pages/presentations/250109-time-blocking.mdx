This presentation introduces a tip how to improve focus, productivity and make things done on time.

## Description

If there’s one thing that can be said about the modern workplace, it’s this: If you don’t control your schedule, it will control you.

Try time blocking if you...

- Handle multiple projects and responsibilities.

- Spend too much time in “reactive mode” checking and responding to messages as they land in your inbox.

- Find your day chopped up by back-to-back meetings, leaving you with the feeling that your day ends before it even starts.

- Battle constant interruptions throughout the day with unexpected requests that disrupt your focus.

- Struggle to find the time and mental space for big-picture thinking.


### Steps
Here’s a step-by-step process for how to time block your day:

- Identify your tasks. List what you need to do for the week. If you’re not used to to-do lists and you tackle tasks as they come, take a week to start tracking what you do. Once you identify your tasks, prioritize them by importance and urgency — the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix) is a great framework for that.
Add them to your Goodle Calendar.

- Create and schedule your work blocks. Assign specific periods for each task or group of tasks, and use a planner or digital calendar to map out your day. You can block time in the morning for high-priority work tasks, midday for meetings, and late afternoon for administrative tasks and emails.

- Balance your schedule. Besides work-related duties be sure to include breaks to rest and recharge!

- Stick to your schedule. Follow your schedule as closely as possible, focusing only on the task assigned to each work block. If something doesn’t get finished, move it to a future block rather than extending the current one.

- Review your day and make adjustments. At the end of every workday, review any tasks you didn’t finish — as well as any new tasks that have come in — and adjust your time blocks for the rest of the week accordingly.

### Benefits
- Boosts productivity

- Provides a clear structure

- Increases focus

- Improves organization by categorizing tasks

- Strengthens time management

### Adaptability
Some frequent pitfalls you should watch out for are:

- Underestimating the time needed for tasks, thinking you can squeeze in just one more thing

- Being too rigid with your schedule, afraid to adjust if things don’t go as planned

- Overscheduling your leisure time, turning relaxation into another form of work

- Not prioritizing tasks, treating everything as equally important

- Failing to account for interruptions and unexpected events
