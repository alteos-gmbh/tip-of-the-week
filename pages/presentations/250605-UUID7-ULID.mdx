This presentation explains why UUID7 and ULID are choices for primary keys in databases, especially for modern, high-scale applications.

## The Importance of ID Choice

Choosing the right ID type impacts:
⚡ Performance  
📈 Scalability  
🔐 Security

Especially critical for:
- Distributed systems
- High-traffic APIs
- Product/catalog pages

## Problems with Auto-Increment IDs

❌ Why auto-increment is outdated:
- Causes table locks in high concurrency
- Easy to guess number/order of records
- Not suitable for distributed systems

## Traditional Solution – UUIDv4

✅ Pros:
- Globally unique
- No coordination needed
- Prevents pattern leakage

❌ Cons:
- Random order degrades database performance

## The Real Problem with UUIDv4

Most databases use B-Trees for indexing:  
📚 Keeps data sorted  
🔍 Enables fast lookups (O(log n))  
⚙️ Supports efficient insert/update/delete

But...

Random UUIDs = 🔄 Disorder  
→ Constant Page Splits  
→ Frequent Tree Rebalancing

### What This Causes

📉 Performance Impact:
- Slow inserts
- High I/O and memory usage
- Poor performance in high-traffic scenarios

## Modern Solutions

Two Better Options:  
🔹 ULID: Timestamp + Random data  
🔹 UUIDv7: Time-ordered, UUID-compliant

## Why ULID & UUIDv7 Work Better

🔑 Inserted in order, not randomly

Benefits:  
✅ Fewer Page Splits  
✅ Faster inserts  
✅ Efficient time-based queries

## When to Use Which

| Feature              | ULID | UUIDv7 |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Shorter, readable    | ✅    | ❌      |
| UUID-compatible      | ❌    | ✅      |
| Lexicographical sort | ✅    | ✅      |

## Format Comparison

##### ULID:
- 26-character Base32 string
- Timestamp encoded at start
- Example: 01AN4Z07BY79KA1307SR9X4MV3

##### UUIDv7:
- Standard UUID format (hex with dashes)
- Timestamp encoded at start
- Example: 017f45e0-7e1a-7a3f-8bbc-4dbf7e6d9c3a

## Final Recommendation

- Use ULID if you value short and readable IDs
- Use UUIDv7 for maximum compatibility with existing systems

Both offer significant improvements in performance and scalability over UUIDv4 and auto-increment IDs.
