This presentation is a book summary.
Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, explores how our brains process information and make decisions. He introduces two thinking systems:
    1.  System 1 (Fast Thinking) – Intuitive, automatic, and emotional, operates automatically (e.g., recognizing a face, dodging danger)
    2.  System 2 (Slow Thinking) – Deliberate, logical, and effortful, kicks in when deeper thinking is needed (e.g., solving a math problem)
Most of our decisions rely on System 1, but it is prone to biases and errors. System 2 can correct these mistakes but is lazy and easily influenced.
