As we enter a new technological era that will reshape the digital landscape we have become accustomed to, us product & tech people will need to pave the way to creating a more accessible environment. This tip of the week aims to explain the value of accessibility, its real-world impact, and how to apply accessibility principles in their work.

## Facts about Accessibility

- Over 2.2 billion people worldwide (27% of the global population) have visual impairments.
- In Germany, 2.7 million people have moderate to severe vision loss, and 229,000 are blind.
- Accessibility in Germany is guided by laws like the EU’s European Accessibility Act (EAA) and the Accessibility Streng

## Why is Accessibility important?

- Starting June 28, 2025, BFSG mandates accessible digital products and services.
- Non-compliance risks sanctions, reputational damage, and competitive disadvantages.
- Accessibility is also an opportunity to expand your audience and improve usability for all.

## What does Accessibility mean? What are the core concepts?

Accessibility — concept of whether a product or service can be used by everyone, however they encounter it

- Key elements of accessibility include validation tools, WCAG standards, assistive technology, access to content, and legal requirements.
- Usability emphasizes ease of use, reaching the broadest audience, user satisfaction, efficiency, and user-centric design.
- Understanding the intersection of accessibility and usability is crucial for creating effective user experiences.

Core Concept 1 - Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a shared international standard for web accessibility. They developed the POUR approach that defines accessibility guidelines:
  1. Perceivable - Perceivable means making sure everyone can understand all elements of a design.
  2. Operable - Providing alternative means of navigation, for people living with permanent disabilities that limit motor function.
  3. Understandable - Designs should be easy to navigate and read. This means creating a visual hierarchy that emphasises navigation, headings, and content structure.
  4. Robust - Focus on making designs accessible on different interfaces.
  
Core Concept 2 - Testing Criteria

For each guideline, there are testable success criteria of different compliance levels.
  1. Level A - Level A is the minimum level of accessibility compliance. While WCAG does accept this level as accessible, it actually does not cover all accessibility barriers.
  2. Level AA - This is the WCAG compliance level you should aim for. Meeting Level AA means a design covers a wide range of accessibility issues and provides an inclusive experience to everyone. 
  3. Level AAA - This is the highest level of compliance and an indication of a design that has gone above and beyond to address accessibility barriers. Note: This level can be difficult to achieve and is not always necessary.

## Best Practises & Tools

Best practices in design to enhance user experience:
- First, ensure sufficient color contrast. This is crucial for readability and accessibility.
- Next, use legible typography. Clear text helps users engage with your content effectively.
- Lastly, offer multiple ways of access, such as search options, menus, and breadcrumb trails. This improves navigation and user satisfaction.

Best practices for development:
- First, using semantic HTML is crucial. It enhances accessibility and improves SEO.
- Next, testing keyboard navigation ensures that all users can interact with your site effectively.
- Lastly, providing error feedback is essential for a positive user experience. It helps users understand and correct their mistakes.

Recommended Tools 
- Adobe Color: which I prefer over the standard WebAIM Contrast Checker.
- Contrast: an easy Figma plugin that scans designs against WCAG testing criteria.
- Axe DevTools: a web extension that automatically identifies accessibility defects.
- WAVE: a web accessibility evaluation tool provided by WebAIM.

## Wrap Up

- Accessibility = inclusivity, compliance, and opportunity.
- Start small with color contrast, semantic HTML, and alt text.
- Use tools like Lighthouse and axe DevTools to test accessibility.
