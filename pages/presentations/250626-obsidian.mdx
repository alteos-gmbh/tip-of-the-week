A Powerful Offline Knowledge Base
**A Daily Tool in My Workflow**

Obsidian is a free, offline-first note-taking app that stores your notes as local Markdown files. It lets you link notes, use tags, and extend functionality with plugins like Kanban boards, Canvas, and Excalidraw. Obsidian is a powerful, privacy-focused alternative to cloud tools like Notion, ideal for building a personal knowledge base.
